BlackPool
=========

BlackPool is an attempt to implement a web application framework 
similar to Seaside for Smalltalk. It is 'heretic' in that, like Seaside, it
does not follow the widely accepted RESTful approach to web development.

**Note:** You will need and Io implementation with Sockets/Volcano support.
